### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 



Term: Spring 2021

+ Project title: Study the ways of people knowing about and getting involved in election campaigns
+ This project is conducted by Zhihang Xia

+ Project summary: 
I will explore the ways of people participating in election campaigns, and how years and their ages affect their choices.
I will answer two questions to explore the data:
1.Generally, in which way would people like to get involved in election campaigns?
2.How do people of different ages engage in election campaigns in different years?
